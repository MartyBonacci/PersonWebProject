# PersonWebProject
My PWP project for Coding bootcamp.

## Milestone 1 Grading Feedback

* You are missing a goal.  The purpose is short and to the point, but the goal should be a bit more verbose and fully explain what you are trying to achieve by building this site.  See [the example](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) for one way to do it.
* Your persona needs to be fully fleshed out.  Minimum requirements are laid out in the assignment.  Usually these run for several paragraphs, or for bulleted lists of 10-20 items.
* You've got one error (typo) and one warning (insufficient language description) when I run your code though the HTML validator.
* There aren't nearly enough commits here, and they are verging on too large.  Make sure you commit frequently and in small chunks of code.

Overall, this is much too sparse to serve as a good base for your PWP.  You need to spend more time on this and augment it so that you have a clear understanding of your site's purpose as you are moving through the remaining milestones.  

The grade for this submission is Tier 1.  **Note that an average of Tier 2 on this project is required to pass the class.**  We will accept a resubmission on this project.  If you resubmit, your grade will be capped at Tier 3.  We will communicate details of the resubmission on Slack.
