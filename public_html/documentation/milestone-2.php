        <h1>Content to be featured</h1>

		 <h3>Header:</h3>

		 <p>
			 In the header there will be a title of some sort, a logo, and an interactive and mobile compatible nav menu.<br>
			 The menu will have links to other websites I have done as well as a link to my GitHub and LinkdIn.  A logo that will represent me as <br>
			 a developer.  The nav menu will be mobile and desktop compatible, and have a fluid feel and animations.<br>
			 I would like the make the nav sticky.
		 </p>


        <ul>
            <li>Page title</li>
            <li>My logo</li>
            <li>A nav menu interactive and adaptable</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

		<h3>Body:</h3>

		<p>
			The body will contain personal content and professional content about me.  I would like to make this almost like a resume.<br>
			If possible I would like to get a small animation or piece of art that I done.  Most importantly I would like to add what I hope<br>
			to accomplish in my developer career.  I would like for this to be a drop down nest type menu, to feature my javascript and CSS skills.<br>
			I would like to have a sample of each skill listed here.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Content about myself</li>
			<li>Links to sites I have done</li>
			<li>A little animation?</li>
			<li>What I want to accomplish</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Footer:</h3>

		<p>
			The footer will contain some of the same links as the nav as well as a type of copyright?  A form and capta will also be featured in<br>
			the footer.  The form will take a name password and email, and the site will send the user an email of the entered information.<br>
			The footer will not be sticky.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Menu Links</li>
			<li>Form</li>
			<li>Capta</li>
